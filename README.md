In this Project, I have a survey Data from respondents on Data Roles.
The process begins with data cleaning process, getting rid of the empty columns and making the dataset relevant for the proceeding analysis and visualizations.
Variables like salary and the Job Titles have to cleaned well since the collected data is disorganized. The avaerage salary is to be computed for the case where the salary range is given.
When the cleaning is done, the visualizations made to result to the the final dashboard.
